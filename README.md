- **Entity Model** : An abstract model representing an entity which belongs to a game model. Stores the position of the model;

- **Entity Body** : An abstract class that wraps the Body class, the body generated by the concrete classes have a custom BodyDef and Fixture. The concrete classes must implement the methods that generate them;

- **Hero Model** : A concrete model representing the hero. Stores the states of the player model;
- **Boss Model** : A concrete model representing the boss. Stores the states of the boss model;
- **Floor Model** : A concrete model representing the floor;

- **Hero Body:** A concrete body representing the hero;

- **Boss Body:**  A concrete body representing the boss;

- **Floor Body:** A concrete body representing the floor;

- **Hero View:** A view which holds the hero sprites. Responsible for updating the sprite position and drawing the correct image;

- **Boss View:** A view which holds the boss sprites. Responsible for updating the sprite position and drawing the correct image;

- **Game View:** A view representing the game screen. Draws all entity views, controls the camera and handles the game input. Has a HUD;

- **HUD:** Strores and shows the score;

- **Game Controller:** Controls the physics engine of the game. Handles collisions and changes the hero and boss states;

- **Menu Screen:** A view representing the menu. Shows the different buttons and handles imputs;

- **Lose Screen:** A view representing the lose of the game.

- **Win Screen:** A view representing the win of the game;

- **Loading Screen:** A view to when the game is loading;

**Design Patters**

- **Singleton** : Singleton was used to ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point  to access it. In this case Game Controller, Game Model and Underboss will only have one instance which can be easily accessed by each other and by the screens.
- **State:** State is used to process the input. The input is received by the GameView and processed by the PlayerModel class. The way it is processesed it is based on a DFA. This makes the code a lot cleaner and less susceptible to bugs when compared to using Booleans for every state possible.
- **Double buffer :** Instead of drawing directly into the screen, use an intermediate buffer instead; then swap the screen contents with the buffer instantaneously. This way the image is more fluid.

**Test Design**

- Checks if the hero moves when it receives the imout to move;
- Checks if the hero lose one life when it gets it by the boss;
- Checks if the game ends when the hero loses his last life;
- Checks if the game is won when the boss dies;
- Checks if the hero don&#39;t move when he is in the end of the floor and the imput is to move even further;
- Checks if the boss loses life when the hero is on the correct place to atack;
- Checks if the score increments when the boss is hit;
